# AX-Annotations
This project provides some annotations `Hack` and `TODO` with which a programmer can note information about the code base, which is then reported during compilation.
Because this uses Java annotation processing (APT), it must be built separately from the main code base.
In addition, to automatically use this with Eclipse, you will want to install the [m2e-apt connector](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/m2e-apt).
